#Notes:
#The password file has the accounts and passwords from the 'mosquitto_passwd' command
#I use an init container to run mosquitto_passwd -U to convert it from the plain text version to a hashed version. 
#The init container is the only one that sees the unhashed password before it's converted and deleted
